# Reinforcement Learning: Solve a Maze
This application solves a maze uisng Q-learning algorithm.

Maze is randomly generated each time.

To change the size of maze, change the value of constant `TILE` from constants.py

Run `start.py` to start the training.

It takes about 100 episodes to learn 9X9 maze.

## Requirements
- python 3
- Numpy
